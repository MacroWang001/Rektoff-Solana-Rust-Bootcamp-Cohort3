## **Course Structure and Content Delivery**

The kickoff session set clear expectations for the upcoming cohort, 
emphasizing a deep technical dive and consistent scheduling to maximize 
learning outcomes (02:10).

- **Module One will begin tomorrow at 8:00am EST and run twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays for about 90 minutes each session** (44:23)
    - Participants must sync the cohort calendar with
    Google Calendar to access meeting links and materials, ensuring smooth
    attendance and resource access.
    - **Daniel Cumming** will lead Module
    One, focusing on Rust fundamentals with a no-stone-unturned approach,
    including compiler internals, memory analysis, and deep dives into
    Rust’s ownership and borrow checker concepts.
    - Lessons include detailed pre-reads and interactive
    visualizers to help students grasp complex memory and state changes,
    supporting progressive mastery.
    - Sessions will often run longer than 90 minutes to
    cover material thoroughly, but all lessons will be recorded for flexible review (09:00).
- **Module Two, led by Mario, will focus exclusively on developing a security research mindset** rather than specific bug blueprints, emphasizing attacker thinking and bug hunting within Anchor-based smart contracts (11:30)
    - The module includes a capstone project simulating a real-world security audit, lasting two to three weeks, designed to
    challenge students to identify novel bugs and apply security-first
    mental models.
    - Guest lectures from industry experts will
    complement the learning, offering practical insights and exposure to
    enterprise practices.
    - Students are strongly advised to start the capstone promptly upon release to avoid failing due to time constraints (16:00).
- The cohort will feature **enhanced enterprise focus**, adding more relevant guest lectures and aligning content with
professional security researcher expectations, improving job readiness (26:00).

## **Assessment and Graduation Criteria**

Assessment design emphasizes learning through feedback and practical engagement while balancing rigor and clarity (19:00).

- **Graduation requires passing two quizzes and the capstone project**, with quiz deadlines typically aligned at the end of Module One or start of Module Two to maintain pacing (19:30).
    - The first quiz is expected to be released on
    Friday, pending platform confirmation, with immediate automated feedback based on simple string matching to help students self-correct before
    formal grading (20:00).
    - Daniel highlighted that quiz questions rely on an
    abstracted memory model rather than hardware-level details, requiring
    students to adopt the course’s conceptual framework for correct answers.
    - Students are encouraged to embrace minor automated
    grading errors without panic, focusing on understanding rather than
    perfection (23:00).
- A **skills report will be provided upon graduation**, detailing competencies gained, which students can use to enhance their resumes and job applications (30:00).

## **Student Support and Community Engagement**

The program prioritizes collaborative learning and continuous support to help students overcome challenges (34:30).

- Daniel and Lucas both emphasized the importance of **asking questions publicly in Slack channels** rather than privately messaging instructors, to foster peer learning and collective problem-solving.
    - This approach will increase engagement, build a
    supportive network, and help students develop professional connections
    crucial for security research careers (35:00).
    - Office hours and asynchronous Slack support are available to help students catch up if they fall behind during live sessions (41:00).
- The program coordinator, **Lucas Hygate**, actively manages onboarding issues, including Notion access and
calendar syncing, promising resolution within hours for outstanding
requests to ensure no student is left behind (42:00).
- Students are encouraged to share research and
discoveries within the Slack community to enrich the learning experience and build camaraderie (34:00).

## **Technical Focus and Pedagogical Approach**

The curriculum is designed for both newcomers and experienced 
developers, blending foundational knowledge with advanced technical 
rigor to boost confidence and capabilities (06:00).

- Daniel’s teaching method focuses on foundational understanding of Rust internals and the Solana runtime, including
exploring unsafe Rust and its memory implications to prepare students
for smart contract development at a low level (28:00).
    - The goal is to empower students to debug and
    investigate systems independently, reducing frustration with language
    tools like the borrow checker.
    - He plans to demonstrate how the Agave Validator and SPVF VM runtime work at the memory and virtual machine level, linking
    theoretical knowledge with practical infrastructure insights (07:30).
- For students coming from EVM or low-level VM
backgrounds, Daniel assured their skills will transfer well due to
Solana’s eBPF-based runtime, which is more register-oriented and thus
more transparent for security research (38:00).
- There will be no focus on MEVs or consensus
protocols like PowerBFT in this course to maintain scope and depth on
smart contract and runtime security (27:48).
- A formal verification tool, **Compass**, is under development and nearing readiness for demonstration, with
plans to illustrate formal proofs on Solana’s token program, potentially adding advanced verification topics if there is interest (46:00).

## **Career Development and Resources**

The program integrates career support and encourages open-source 
contributions to help students build professional profiles and job 
readiness (29:34).

- The **Rector Launchpad** offers job referrals, community connections, and links to Solana ecosystem
opportunities, acting as a bridge between learning and employment.
    - While no job guarantees are made, the skills
    developed and the launchpad network increase students’ chances in the
    Solana job market.
    - Students receive a skills report at graduation to formalize their learning achievements (30:30).
- Students are encouraged to contribute to
open-source Anchor projects, though no specific recommended repositories were identified; community members are invited to share leads to foster collaborative growth (43:40).
- The cohort will include more enterprise-relevant guest lectures to better prepare students for professional security roles (26:00).

## **Operational and Administrative Details**

The program team is actively managing logistical challenges to ensure smooth onboarding and ongoing communication (00:40).

- Certificates of acceptance are being finalized and
expected to be delivered within the first week; students should DM Lucas for any missing documents to avoid delays (36:30).
- All course materials, including pre-reads and
documents, are hosted on Notion with Slack channels used for
announcements and discussion, ensuring centralized and accessible
resources (00:24).
- The program is designed to be demanding, requiring
persistence and a disciplined mindset, especially for those new to Rust
and smart contract security, but support structures are in place to help all students succeed (31:00).
- Lucas and Daniel emphasized a culture of patience,
persistence, and collaboration, encouraging students to maintain
engagement and leverage community and instructor support to overcome

learning challenges (33:00).
